This projects provides an understanding of the "Link List" in C Programming with focus on Data Structure, Array, Node and the application of the various types of link list i a given program.
The sourcecode are executed thus;

0 - Writes a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.
* Return: the number of nodes
* If str is NULL, print [0] (nil)

1 - Writes a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.

2 - Writes a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.
* Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed
* str needs to be duplicated.

3 - Writes a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.
* Return: the address of the new elemen

4 - Writes a function that frees a list_t list.

5 - Writes a function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.

6 - Writes a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.

The entire code uses the printf function and the program is compiled using nasm and gcc.

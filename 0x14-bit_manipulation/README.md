This project encapsulates Bit manipulation and the application of bitwise operators in C programming.
The prototypes of the entire fuctions are stored in the main.h file.
The programes are executed thus;

0 - Writes a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
* where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars,
* Return: the converted number, or 0 if;
* there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1.
* b is NULL.

1 - Writes a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

2 - Writes a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
* where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to get.
* Returns: the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occured.

3 - Writes a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
* where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
* Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred.

4 - Writes a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
* where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set.
* Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred.

5 - Writes a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

6 - Writes a function that checks the endianness.
* Returns: 0 if big endian, 1 if little endian.

7 - Finds the password of a given program.
* Save the password in the file 101-password.
* The file should contains the exact password, no new line, no extra space.

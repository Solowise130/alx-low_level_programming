In this project, I learned what static libraries are and practiced creating and using them with ar, ranlib, and nm.

0 - Creates a static library called "libmy.a" containing a list of functions.
1 - Creates a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
